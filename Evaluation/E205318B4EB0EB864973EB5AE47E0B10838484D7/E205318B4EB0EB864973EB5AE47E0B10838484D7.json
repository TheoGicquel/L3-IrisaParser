This study is confined to the interaction between two of those strata, namely treaties and customs, and does not deal with the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations. After the introductory chapter, the author first examines the creation of customary international law, and then the confirmation of custom and the extinction of custom (desuetude). The fifth chapter deals with treaties and its relation with contracting and non-contracting parties. Subsequently Professor Dinstein examines the application of treaties and custom to individuals and groups, and in the chapters that follow he studies the basic relationship between treaty and custom, the modes of coexistence of treaty and custom, jus cogens and jus dipositivum, and the impact of subsequent practice on treaties. The twelfth chapter deals with the interaction between binding decisions of the Security Council, custom and treaty.","language":["unknown"],"doi":["10.1163/ej.9789004161016.243-428"],"bookId":["er322_243-428"],"isbn":["9789004161016"],"volume":"322","pages":{"first":"243","last":"258"},"genre":["reference-works"],"author":[{"name":"Yoram Dinstein"}],"subject":[{"value":"Traités"},{"value":"Droit coutumier international"},{"value":"Droit des traités"},{"value":"Convention de Vienne sur le droit des traités (Vienne, 23 mai 1969)"},{"value":"Treaties"},{"value":"International customary law"},{"value":"Law of treaties"},{"value":"Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (Vienna, 23 May 1969)"}]},"ark":["ark:/67375/TP3-0K4T8WNW-1"],"publicationDate":"2007","copyrightDate":"2007","enrichments":{"type":["refBibs","teeft"]},"doi":["10.1163/ej.9789004161016.243-428.1"],"_id":"E205318B4EB0EB864973EB5AE47E0B10838484D7"}
