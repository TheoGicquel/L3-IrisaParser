From a medical point of view, computerized programs can be used to memorize patients’ individual records and profiles, to facilitate patient management and follow-up, to store medical knowledge about hypertension and to provide facilities for decision making at the level either of the individual patient or of the population followed up. From a technical point of view, the methodology used integrates data and knowledge management facilities into the same software. Five hypertension clinics are presently using the system in France and more than 22,000 records have been registered. Answer rates to 12 mandatory questions regarding past history and examination at first visit were superior to 95% in 19,601 records created between January 1976 and December 1987. Patient database interrogation can be used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of various signs and symptoms for the diagnosis of secondary hypertension, and to predict, for each patient, his/her cardiovascular risk, the risk of drop-out, the risk of insufficient blood pressure control and the probable blood pressure level. It also serves to test the content and validity of the associated expert system which is progressively built up. A prospective evaluation of the performance of the expert system on 80 cases of hypertension showed overall agreement between the specialists and the expert system ranging from 58 to 91% depending on the decision. The results suggest that a strategy combining data and knowledge management might help the physician to supplement theoretical knowledge derived from the academic environment, and in some cases to replace it by a more pragmatic knowledge derived from his experience stored in the computer.
