Being a product of seven years of scientific cooperation between Ifpo, the Royal Jordanian Geographic Center and the University of Jordan, it includes the contributions of 48 European, Jordanian and International researchers.

Jordan has always been looked on as an exception in the Middle East due to the political stability that has prevailed since the country’s Independence in 1946, despite the challenge of integrating several waves of Palestinian, Iraqi and - more recently - Syrian refugees. Thanks to this stability and the peace accord signed with Israel in 1994, Jordan is one of the first countries in the world for development aid per capita.","language":["unknown"],"copyrightDate":"2013","eisbn":["9782351594384"],"isbn":["9782351593783"],"pages":{"first":"344","last":"353"},"genre":["book"],"editor":[{"name":"Ababsa Myriam"}],"subject":[{"value":"formation des territoires"},{"value":"Jordanie"},{"value":"géographie"},{"value":"géographie historique"},{"value":"territoire"},{"value":"démographie"},{"value":"développement"},{"value":"atlas"},{"value":"histoire"},{"value":"Jordan"},{"value":"geography"},{"value":"territory"},{"value":"development"}]},"ark":["ark:/67375/9TJ-FJ91CQ53-P"],"categories":{"inist":["1 - sciences humaines et sociales"]},"publicationDate":"2013","copyrightDate":"2013","enrichments":{"type":["nb","refBibs","teeft"]},"_id":"D479DD1EEAA3F8D7013BC0E558AA330CBEC7B580"}
