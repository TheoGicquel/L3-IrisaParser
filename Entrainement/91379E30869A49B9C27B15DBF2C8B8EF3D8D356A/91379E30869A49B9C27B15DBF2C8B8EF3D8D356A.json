Musical research could accordingly profit greatly from a closer engagement with developments in other humanities fields, which have long grappled with the issues of virtuality and concrete implementation of electronic resources. The lessons learned from decades of media studies allow one to avoid naïve technological determinism which posits an opposition between book and computer. The real issue is not whether one format or medium is superior, but rather how future forms of publication can be responsibly designed by those who will rely most heavily upon them. To facilitate informed judgments concerning existing and potential editorial/publication approaches, early music editions are historicized and contextualized in three case studies: the ritualized physical space of the academic library; the strongly print-/book-influenced models of editions in the popularizing network context of the World Wide Web; and the conceptual quandaries and limitations involved in developing new ‘dynamic’ online editions. In each case—including digital publication—‘materiality’ can be seen as an overriding factor in how editions are discovered, acquired, read, performed. The new digital edition thus treads a fine line. Physical, conventional, and social aspects of interactivity play an important role in shaping online publication, but this is not the same as the simplistic idea that electronic editions have intrinsic characteristics determined by their status as virtual entities. Rather, the fundamental elements of online music editions are shaped in the process of design and implementation, too often in practice without regard to their musicological integrity and future usability. It is imperative, therefore, for practitioners and scholars to become more actively engaged in the ongoing development process of such edition systems.","qualityIndicators":{"hasStructuredBody":false,"teiSource":"pub2tei","xmlStats":{"paragraphCount":1,"sectionCount":1,"sectionLevels":[{"level":0,"sectionCount":1}],"sectionDepth":1,"imageCount":0,"tableCount":0,"refCount":0},"tdmReady":false,"score":10,"pdfWordCount":10395,"pdfCharCount":59071,"pdfVersion":1.6,"pdfPageCount":23,"pdfPageSize":"561.35 x 776.65 pts","pdfWordsPerPage":452,"pdfText":true,"refBibsNative":false,"abstractWordCount":290,"abstractCharCount":2054,"keywordCount":0},"title":"The Material Digital: Strategies of Making and Reading the Early Music Edition, Then and Now","hasFormula":false,"refBibs":[{"title":"> <xs:element name=\"Sign\"><xs:complexType><xs:sequence> <xs:element name=\"MainSymbol\"><xs:simpleType><xs:restriction base=\"xs:string\"> <xs:pattern value=><xs:simpleType><xs:restriction base=\"xs:string\"> <xs:pattern value=\"Reversed|90CW|90CCW\"/> </xs:restriction></xs:simpleType></xs:element> <xs:element name=\"Strokes\" type=\"xs:unsignedInt\" minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"1\"/> <xs:element name=\"Dot\" minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"1\"/> </xs:sequence></xs:complexType></xs:element> <xs:element name=\"Number\"><xs:complexType><xs:sequence> <xs:group ref=","host":{"pages":{"first":"0","last":"1"},"title":"element> <xs:element name=\"Orientation\" minOccurs=\"0"}},{"title":"Cornells Lindenburg, Corpus Mensurabilis Musicae 9 (s.l., 1956) For some more specific remarks on the shortcomings of this editionReconstructing and Repositioning Regis's Ave maria","author":[{"name":"Johannes Regis"},{"name":"Opera Omnia"}],"host":{"pages":{"first":"73","last":"88"},"title":"Early Music","publicationDate":"2009","volume":"37"}},{"title":"On debunking the notion of 'supersession' in particular, see Paul Duguid","host":{"pages":{"first":"63","last":"101"},"title":"Material Matters: The Past and Futurology of the Book' in The Future of the Book"}},{"host":{"pages":{"first":"4444"},"title":"Digital Formations: Constructing an Object of Study, in Digital Formations: IT and New Architectures in the Global Realm","author":[{"name":"Saskia Latham"},{"name":"Sassen"}],"publicationDate":"2005","editor":"Robert Latham and Saskia Sassen"}}],"genre":["research-article"],"host":{"title":"Journal of the Alamire Foundation","language":["unknown"],"issn":["2032-5371"],"publisherId":["jaf"],"volume":"1","issue":"1","pages":{"first":"125","last":"147"},"genre":["journal"]},"ark":["ark:/67375/NDQ-1D6PQ87V-X"],"categories":{"inist":["1 - sciences humaines et sociales"]},"publicationDate":"2009","copyrightDate":"2009","enrichments":{"type":["nb","refBibs","teeft"]},"doi":["10.1484/J.JAF.1.100443"],"_id":"91379E30869A49B9C27B15DBF2C8B8EF3D8D356A"}
