I introduce non-linearity in teaching history, in particular in teaching history of science, as an alternative to standard didactics. Timelines are fundamental to linear teaching, but they are also valuable as a supplement to non-linear accounts. Hence, it is anticipated that a hybrid account (combining a non-linear approach with an evidently linear timeline “on the side”) serves an adequate understanding of the history of science better. An elaborated non-linear account of early radio astronomy is chosen as illustration. My aim is to contribute to a more efficient, adequate and above all sincere didactics of the history of science.","qualityIndicators":{"hasStructuredBody":false,"teiSource":"pub2tei","xmlStats":{"paragraphCount":1,"sectionCount":1,"sectionLevels":[{"level":0,"sectionCount":1}],"sectionDepth":1,"imageCount":0,"tableCount":0,"refCount":0},"tdmReady":false,"score":7.845,"pdfWordCount":5865,"pdfCharCount":30993,"pdfVersion":1.5,"pdfPageCount":16,"pdfPageSize":"442.3 x 663.35 pts","pdfWordsPerPage":367,"pdfText":true,"refBibsNative":false,"abstractWordCount":126,"abstractCharCount":854,"keywordCount":0},"title":"Against Chronological and Impersonal Accounts of the History of Science.
