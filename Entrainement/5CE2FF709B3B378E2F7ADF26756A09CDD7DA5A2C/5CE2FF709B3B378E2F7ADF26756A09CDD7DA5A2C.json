The Web as an instrument of information dissemination gives the citizen who uses it many advantages. Unlike other information services where the flow of information is targeted at a specific part of the population, the Public Administration Sector generates information that is, or should be, useful to any citizen, regardless of his or her situation or profession. Throughout life, one has to interact with local, regional, and national Public Administrative units. Sometimes the process is direct between a citizen and the staff of these units, but on other occasions the Administration itself has to structure the flow of information to the citizen. The Web has become an effective tool in this sense, but who are the professionals managing these information resources? The present work will show that Spanish universities offering courses in librarianship and information science have remained unaware of these new job opportunities that have arisen in recent years. Data used to support this conclusion are: 1) Spanish reports on the job market for librarianship and information science graduates, 2) study plans at the different levels of higher education in Spain (first, second, and third cycles of university), and 3) the educational qualifications of the website administrators of Spain's provincial capitals, a typical sample of Spanish public administrative units.","qualityIndicators":{"hasStructuredBody":false,"teiSource":"pub2tei","xmlStats":{"paragraphCount":1,"sectionCount":1,"sectionLevels":[{"level":0,"sectionCount":1}],"sectionDepth":1,"imageCount":0,"tableCount":0,"refCount":0},"tdmReady":false,"refBibsNative":false,"abstractWordCount":245,"abstractCharCount":1622,"keywordCount":0,"score":9.94,"pdfWordCount":6487,"pdfCharCount":36796,"pdfVersion":1.6,"pdfPageCount":11,"pdfPageSize":"595 x 842 pts (A4)","pdfWordsPerPage":590,"pdfText":true},"title":"LIS Education and Web Services in the Public Sector: the Case of Spain","hasFormula":false,"refBibs":[{"host":{"title":"It has some practicum centres in which corporate information is administered through Web pages"}},{"host":{"title":"Référentiel des métiers-types des professionnels de l'information-documentation","author":[{"name":"Adbs"}],"publicationDate":"2001","publisher":"ADBS Édi- tions"}},{"host":{"title":"Euroguide LIS: the guide to competencies for European professionals in library and information services Relación de eurocompetencias en información y documentación , ECIA (European Council of Information Associations )","publicationDate":"2000","publisher":"SEDIC"}},{"title":"Análisis comparativo regional del desarrollo de la Administración local española en Internet","author":[{"name":"Chaín Navarro"},{"name":"C"},{"name":"A"},{"name":"Muñoz Cañavate"}],"host":{"pages":{"first":"96","last":"116"},"title":"Investigación Bibliotecológica","publicationDate":"1997","volume":"18","issue":"36"}},{"title":"Las prácticas universitarias para estudiantes de la Facultad de Documentación en la Universidad de Murcia: análisis de las tareas realizadas","author":[{"name":"Chaín Navarro"},{"name":"C"},{"name":"J Garrido Lova"},{"name":"E Lucas"},{"name":"A Martínez"},{"name":"Pellicer"}],"host":{"pages":{"first":"323","last":"353"},"title":"Revista General de Información y Documentación","publicationDate":"1991"}},{"title":"Information Policies in Spain","author":[{"name":"A Cornella"}],"host":{"pages":{"first":"197","last":"200"},"title":"Government Information Quarterly","publicationDate":"1998","volume":"2","issue":"15"}},{"title":"Cutting the Gordian knot","author":[{"name":"B Cronin"}],"host":{"pages":{"first":"897","last":"902"},"title":"Information Processing & Management","publicationDate":"1995","volume":"31","issue":"6"}},{"host":{"title":"Informe anual sobre la Sociedad de la Información en España Fundación France Telecom España","publicationDate":"2006"}},{"title":"The Future for Library Science Education","author":[{"name":"G E Gorman"}],"host":{"pages":{"first":"1","last":"10"},"title":"Libri","publicationDate":"1999","volume":"49","issue":"1"}},{"host":{"title":"Ley General Tributaria","publicationDate":"2003"}},{"host":{"author":[{"name":"Ley Para El Acceso Electrónico De Los Ciudadanos A Las Administraciones"},{"name":"Públicas"}],"publicationDate":"2007-10-01"}},{"host":{"author":[{"name":"F Michavila"},{"name":"B Calvo"}],"publicationDate":"1998"}},{"host":{"author":[{"name":"Ministerio De Educación"}],"publicationDate":"2004","publisher":"Libro Blanco: Título"}}],"genre":["research-article"],"host":{"title":"Libri","language":["unknown"],"publicationDate":"2008","copyrightDate":"2008","issn":["0024-2667"],"eissn":["1865-8423"],"publisherId":["LIBR"],"volume":"58","issue":"4","pages":{"first":"246","last":"256"},"genre":["journal"]},"namedEntities":{"unitex":{"date":["2000","1992","1981","2005","1990s","2006","2009-01-15","1998","month of March 2007","1983","2007","in the Twentieth Century","In the Nineteenth Century","2003","1995","1991","1980s","2004"],"geogName":["Tributary Law","Region of the Balearic Islands"],"orgName":["Organisation","Ministry of Education","France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom","Spain In Spain","Ministry of Labour","University of Valencia","Spain’s National Institute of Statistics","University of Murcia","Spain Antonio Muñoz Cañavate Área","University of Zaragoza","Fundación France Telecom España","Spain Verónica Salido Martínez Fundación Centro"],"persName":["Ley de Régimen","LIS Education","Celia Chain-Navarro","Spanish","Benjamín","Antonio Muñoz","Education","Job Market","English","Ley General","Worker","Cronin","Paris Sorbonne","Library","La Merced","Web","Alfons Cornella","Francisco Michavila"],"placeName":["Salamanca","León","Zaragoza","Badajoz","Madrid","Bologna","Europe","Barcelona","Murcia","Granada","Spain"]}},"ark":["ark:/67375/QT4-SBM6QM87-2"],"categories":{"wos":["1 -
