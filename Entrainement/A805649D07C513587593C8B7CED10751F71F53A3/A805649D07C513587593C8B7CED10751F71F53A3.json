Design: Systematic review of world reports from 1984 to 1994. Setting: The computerised catalogues of Medline, BIDS, and GPlit were searched, as well as conference proceedings, books, bibliographies, and references in books and journal articles. Subjects: 30 papers met the inclusion criteria and were included for detailed review. Interventions: A validated scheme for assessing methodological adequacy was used to score each paper. Main outcome measures: Papers were rated on sample formation, baseline differences, unit of allocation, outcome measures, and follow up. Differences in outcomes were also recorded. Results: Four of the six papers dealing with the consultation process showed that consultations took longer. Doctor initiated and “medical” content of consultations increased at the expense of a reduction in patient initiated and “social” content. Each of the 21 studies which looked at clinician performance showed an improvement when a computer was used (from 8% to 50%, with better results for single preventive measures). Only one of the three studies looking at patient outcomes showed an improvement (diastolic blood pressure control 5 mm Hg better after one year, with fewer doctor-patient consultations). Conclusions: Using a computer in the consultation may help improve clinician performance but may increase the length of the consultation. More studies are needed to assess the effects on patient outcomes of using a computer in consultations.","qualityIndicators":{"hasStructuredBody":true,"teiSource":"pub2tei","xmlStats":{"paragraphCount":26,"sectionCount":11,"sectionLevels":[{"level":0,"sectionCount":4},{"level":1,"sectionCount":7}],"sectionDepth":2,"imageCount":1,"tableCount":4,"refCount":56},"tdmReady":true,"score":7.796,"pdfWordCount":5155,"pdfCharCount":28808,"pdfVersion":1.3,"pdfPageCount":5,"pdfPageSize":"595.27 x 841.89 pts (A4)","pdfWordsPerPage":1031,"pdfText":true,"refBibsNative":true,"abstractWordCount":233,"abstractCharCount":1581,"keywordCount":0},"title":"Has general practitioner computing made a difference to patient care?
