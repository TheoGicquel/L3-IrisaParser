But suitable design guidance for this task is rare. This paper proposes the theory of primary metaphor and explores its validity as a source of design guidance. Primary metaphor theory describes how basic mental representations of physical sensorimotor experiences are extended to understand abstract domains. As primary metaphors are subconscious mental representations that are highly automated, they should be robustly available to people with differing levels of cognitive ability. Their proposed universality should make them accessible to people with differing levels of prior experience with technology. These predictions were tested for 12 primary metaphors that predict relations between spatial gestures and abstract interactive content. In an empirical study, 65 participants from two age groups (young and old) were asked to produce two-dimensional touch and three-dimensional free-form gestures in response to given abstract keywords and spatial dimensions of movements. The results show that across age groups in 92% of all cases users choose gestures that confirmed the predictions of the theory. Although the two age groups differed in their cognitive abilities and prior experience with technology, overall they did not differ in the amount of metaphor-congruent gestures they made. As predicted, only small or zero correlations of metaphor-congruent gestures with prior experience or cognitive ability could be found. The results provide a promising step toward inclusive design guidelines for gesture interaction with abstract content on mobile multitouch devices.","qualityIndicators":{"hasStructuredBody":true,"teiSource":"pub2tei","xmlStats":{"paragraphCount":79,"sectionCount":19,"sectionLevels":[{"level":0,"sectionCount":6},{"level":1,"sectionCount":13}],"sectionDepth":2,"imageCount":3,"tableCount":6,"refCount":56},"tdmReady":true,"score":10,"pdfWordCount":9969,"pdfCharCount":55145,"pdfVersion":1.7,"pdfPageCount":10,"pdfPageSize":"595.276 x 793.701 pts","pdfWordsPerPage":997,"pdfText":true,"refBibsNative":true,"abstractWordCount":252,"abstractCharCount":1748,"keywordCount":6},"title":"Physical gestures for abstract concepts: Inclusive design with primary metaphors","hasFormula":true,"refBibs":[{"title":"What the body knows: exploring the benefits of embodied metaphors in hybrid physical digital environments","author":[{"name":"A N Antle"},{"name":"G Corness"},{"name":"M Droumeva"}],"host":{"pages":{"first":"66","last":"75"},"title":"Interacting with Computers","publicationDate":"2009","volume":"21","issue":"1-2"}},{"title":"Mobile interaction with geo-notes: a gesture-driven user interface for browsing user-generated content in mobile web applications","author":[{"name":"H Aras"},{"name":"D Huber"}],"host":{"pages":{"first":"25","last":"36"},"title":"Intelligent Interactive Assistance and Mobile Multimedia Computing","publicationDate":"2009","publisher":"Springer"}},{"doi":"doi:10.1145/1551788.1551812","title":"Identifying embodied metaphors in children's sound-action mappings","author":[{"name":"S Bakker"},{"name":"A N Antle"},{"name":"E Van Der Hoven"}],"host":{"pages":{"first":"140","last":"149"},"title":"Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Interaction Design and Children","publicationDate":"2009","publisher":"ACM","editor":"Paolini, P., Garzotto, F."}},{"host":{"title":"Metapher und Kognition, Grundlagen einer neuen Theorie der Alltagsmetapher","author":[{"name":"C Baldauf"}],"publicationDate":"1997"}},{"doi":"doi:10.1017/S135561770410307X","title":"The d2 test of attention: construct validity and extensions in scoring techniques","author":[{"name":"M E Bates"},{"name":"E P Lemay"}],"host":{"pages":{"first":"392","last":"400"},"title":"Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society","publicationDate":"2004","volume":"10","issue":"03"}},{"title":"Intuitive interaction, prior experience and ageing: an empirical study","author":[{"name":"A Blackler"},{"name":"D Mahar"},{"name":"V Popovic"}],"host":{"title":"HCI 2009 Electronic Proceedings: WS4 -Prior Experience","publicationDate":"2009","publisher":"British Computer Society"}},{"title":"The British National Corpus","author":[{"name":"R Brickenkamp"},{"name":"E Zillmer"}],"host":{"title":"BNC","publicationDate":"1998","publisher":"Hogrefe and Huber Publishers"}},{"title":"BS 7000, Design Management Systems -Part 6: Managing Inclusive Design -Guide","host":{"title":"BSI","publicationDate":"2005","publisher":"British Standards Institution"}},{"title":"Precise effects of control position, indicator type, and scale side on human performance","author":[{"name":"A Chan"},{"name":"V Shum"},{"name":"H Law"},{"name":"I Hui"}],"host":{"pages":{"first":"380","last":"386"},"title":"The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology","publicationDate":"2003","volume":"22","issue":"5"}},{"title":"A coefficient of agreement for nominal scales","author":[{"name":"J Cohen"}],"host":{"pages":{"first":"37","last":"46"},"title":"Educational and Psychological Measurement","publicationDate":"1960","volume":"20","issue":"1"}},{"title":"Factors predicting the use of technology: findings from the center for research and education on aging and technology enhancement (CREATE)","author":[{"name":"S J Czaja"},{"name":"N Charness"},{"name":"A D Fisk"},{"name":"C Hertzog"},{"name":"S N Nair"},{"name":"W A Rogers"},{"name":"J Sharit"}],"host":{"pages":{"first":"333","last":"352"},"title":"Psychology and Aging","publicationDate":"2006","volume":"21","issue":"2"}},{"title":"The impact of aging on access to technology","author":[{"name":"S J Czaja"},{"name":"C C Lee"}],"host":{"pages":{"first":"341","last":"349"},"title":"Universal Access in the Information Society","publicationDate":"2007","volume":"5","issue":"4"}},{"host":{"title":"Technology Generations Handling Complex User Interfaces, Doctoral Dissertation","author":[{"name":"Docampo Rama"},{"name":"M"}],"publicationDate":"2001"}},{"host":{"title":"Designing for Older Adults.
