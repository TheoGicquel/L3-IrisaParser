This study develops a virtual two-dimensional flow model replicating an in vitro aneurysm model and analyzes how changes in morphology modify flow characteristics. Methods Using finite volume analysis, a two-dimensional saccular aneurysm model was created with a configuration matching a published, experimental, in vitro model. Qualitative comparisons were made determining whether a two-dimensional fluid dynamic model can replicate the results of an in vitro model. Quantitative changes in flow patterns, wall shear stress, dynamic pressure and maximum velocities were assessed by modifying the shape of the neck and proximal dome without modifying the overall size of the aneurysm. Results A two-dimensional computational fluid dynamic model reproducing the shape of a published aneurysm demonstrated excellent qualitative fidelity to an in vitro flow model. Additional information regarding dynamic pressure, shear stress and velocity along the aneurysm neck and within the aneurysm dome were determined. Although all dimensions were kept constant, slight modifications of the neck and proximal dome resulted in quantitative changes in studied parameters, such as wall shear stress and dynamic pressure. Conclusions Computer generated aneurysm flow models, when carefully developed, reproduce flow events within in vitro aneurysms providing objective data on biophysical parameters. Effective flow modeling of aneurysms depends on flow input, size of the parent vessel and aneurysm, and other factors. These data suggest that neck and proximal dome configuration, independent of size, are important characteristics of flow.","qualityIndicators":{"hasStructuredBody":true,"teiSource":"pub2tei","xmlStats":{"paragraphCount":30,"sectionCount":13,"sectionLevels":[{"level":0,"sectionCount":4},{"level":1,"sectionCount":9}],"sectionDepth":2,"imageCount":5,"tableCount":0,"refCount":36},"tdmReady":true,"score":8,"pdfWordCount":5447,"pdfCharCount":31477,"pdfVersion":1.3,"pdfPageCount":8,"pdfPageSize":"651.855 x 850.28 pts","pdfWordsPerPage":681,"pdfText":true,"refBibsNative":true,"abstractWordCount":258,"abstractCharCount":1823,"keywordCount":2},"title":"Computational fluid dynamic simulation to assess flow characteristics of an in vitro aneurysm model","pmid":["21994278"],"hasFormula":true,"refBibs":[{"title":"Mathematical model for the rupture of cerebral saccular aneurysms through three-dimensional stress distribution in the aneurysm wall","author":[{"name":"Hr Chaudhry"},{"name":"Da Lott"},{"name":"Cj Prestigiacomo"}],"host":{"pages":{"first":"325","last":"35"},"title":"Journal of Mechanics in Medicine and Biology","publicationDate":"2006","volume":"6"}},{"title":"Fluid-structure interaction within realistic three-dimensional models of the aneurysmatic aorta as a guidance to assess the risk of rupture of the aneurysm","author":[{"name":"Di Martino"},{"name":"Es Buadagni"},{"name":"G Fumero"},{"name":"A"}],"host":{"pages":{"first":"647","last":"55"},"title":"Med Eng Phys","publicationDate":"2001","volume":"23"}},{"title":"Model studies of the flow in abdominal aortic aneurysms during resting and exercise conditions","author":[{"name":"Cj Egelhoff"},{"name":"Rs Budwig"},{"name":"Df Elger"}],"host":{"pages":{"first":"1319","last":"29"},"title":"J Biomech","publicationDate":"1999","volume":"32"}},{"title":"Mathematical model of the rupture mechanism of intracranial saccular aneurysms through daughter aneurysm formation and growth","author":[{"name":"H Meng"},{"name":"Y Feng"},{"name":"Sh Woodward"}],"host":{"pages":{"first":"459","last":"65"},"title":"Neurol Res","publicationDate":"2005","volume":"27"}},{"title":"Predicting rupture probabilities through the application of a CTA-derived binary logistic regression model","author":[{"name":"Cj Prestigiacomo"},{"name":"W He"},{"name":"T Mcintosh"}],"host":{"pages":{"first":"1","last":"6"},"title":"J Neurosurg","publicationDate":"2009","volume":"110"}},{"title":"In vitro measurement of fluidinduced wall shear stress in unruptured cerebral aneurysms harboring blebs","author":[{"name":"S Tateshima"},{"name":"Y Murayama"},{"name":"Jp Villablanca"}],"host":{"pages":{"first":"187","last":"92"},"title":"Stroke","publicationDate":"2003","volume":"34"}},{"host":{"pages":{"first":"100","last":"107"},"title":"J NeuroIntervent Surg","publicationDate":"2009","volume":"1"}},{"host":{"title":"Basic science"}},{"title":"A model of early stage aneurysm development based on an inelastic multi-mechanism constitutive equation.
