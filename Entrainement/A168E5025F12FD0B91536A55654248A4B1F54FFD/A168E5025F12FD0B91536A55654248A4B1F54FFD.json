Computer-enabled discharge communications may improve information transfer by providing a standardised document that immediately links acute and community healthcare providers. Objective To conduct a systematic review evaluating the efficacy of computer-enabled discharge communication compared with traditional communication for patients discharged from acute care hospitals. Data sources MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials and MEDLINE In-Process. Keywords from three themes were combined: discharge communication, electronic/online/web-based and controlled interventional studies. Study selection Study types included: clinical trials, quasiexperimental studies with concurrent controls and controlled before–after studies. Interventions included: (1) automatic population of a discharge document by computer database(s); (2) transmission of discharge information via computer technology; or (3) computer technology providing a ‘platform’ for dynamic discharge communication. Controls included: no intervention or traditional manual/dictated discharge summaries. Primary outcomes included: mortality, readmission and adverse events/near misses. Secondary outcomes included: timeliness, accuracy, quality/completeness and physician/patient satisfaction. Data extraction Description of interventions and study outcomes were extracted by two independent reviewers. Results 12 unique studies were identified: eight randomised controlled trials and four quasi-experimental studies. Pooling/meta-analysis was not possible, given the heterogeneity of measures and outcomes reported. The primary outcomes of mortality and readmission were inconsistently reported. There was no significant difference in mortality, and one study reported reduced long-term readmission. Intervention groups experienced reductions in perceived medical errors/adverse events, and improvements in timeliness and physician/patient satisfaction. Conclusions Computer-enabled discharge communications appear beneficial with respect to a number of important secondary outcomes. Primary outcomes of mortality and readmission are less commonly reported in this literature and require further study.","qualityIndicators":{"hasStructuredBody":true,"teiSource":"pub2tei","xmlStats":{"paragraphCount":184,"sectionCount":18,"sectionLevels":[{"level":0,"sectionCount":5},{"level":1,"sectionCount":13}],"sectionDepth":2,"imageCount":1,"tableCount":4,"refCount":34},"tdmReady":true,"score":8.667,"pdfWordCount":6963,"pdfCharCount":42157,"pdfVersion":1.4,"pdfPageCount":13,"pdfPageSize":"595.276 x 793.701 pts","pdfWordsPerPage":536,"pdfText":true,"refBibsNative":true,"abstractWordCount":266,"abstractCharCount":2292,"keywordCount":5},"title":"The efficacy of computer-enabled discharge communication interventions: a systematic review","pmid":["21262793"],"hasFormula":false,"refBibs":[{"host":{"title":"Adverse events/near misses, timeliness, quality/ completeness 2 Adverse events/near misses: PCP perceived"}},{"host":{"title":"Timeliness: proportion of summaries completed within 3 days postdischarge"}},{"host":{"title":"Timeliness: PCP rating (5-Point Likert Scale: very dissatisfied (1) to very satisfied (5))"}},{"host":{"title":"Quality/completeness: proportions of summary elements present (16 elements using custom 'Discharge Summary Completeness Score')"}},{"host":{"title":"Quality/completeness: clarity/readability of summary (5-Point Likert Scale: unintelligible (1) to lucid (5))"}},{"host":{"title":"IG PCPs perceived that 1 or more of their patients hospitalised in the preceding 6 months sustained a near miss (65.7% vs 52.9%, p¼0.008) or a preventable adverse event (40.7% vs 30.2%, p¼0.02) due to poor information transfer before implementing IG summaries 2"}},{"host":{"title":"09 vs control summaries 2.5961.02 (p#0.001) 4. 3/16 elements more common in IG summaries: discussion of follow-up issues (52.0% vs 75.8%; p¼0.001), pending test results (13.9% vs 46.3%; p<0.001), and information provided to the patient and/or family (85.1% vs 95.8%; p¼0.01) 5.
