The abstract learning space, where all agents are located,is constructed here using a fully connected model that couples all agents withrandom strength values. The cellular automata network simulates the higher levelintegration of information acquired from the independent learning trials. The finalclassification of incoming input data is therefore defined as the stationary state of themeta-learning system using simple majority rule, yet the minority clusters that share theopposite classification outcome can be observed in the system. Therefore, theprobability of selecting a proper class for a given input data, can be estimatedeven without the prior knowledge of its affiliation. The fuzzy logic can be easilyintroduced into the system, even if learning agents are built from simple binaryclassification machine learning algorithms by calculating the percentage of agreeingagents.","qualityIndicators":{"score":9.208,"pdfWordCount":7203,"pdfCharCount":42292,"pdfVersion":1.4,"pdfPageCount":15,"pdfPageSize":"594.72 x 840.96 pts","refBibsNative":true,"abstractWordCount":184,"abstractCharCount":1345,"keywordCount":4},"title":"Mean-field theory of meta-learning","pii":["S1742-5468(09)34810-4"],"refBibs":[{"host":{"author":[]}},{"author":[{"name":"J Bacardit"}],"host":{"volume":"10","author":[],"title":"BMC Bioinform."},"title":"Automated alphabet reduction for protein datasets"},{"author":[{"name":"D Plewczynski"}],"host":{"volume":"21","author":[],"title":"Bioinformatics"},"title":"AutoMotif server: prediction of single residue post-translational modifications in proteins"},{"author":[{"name":"H Bhaskar"},{"name":"D C Hoyle"},{"name":"S Singh"}],"host":{"volume":"36","author":[],"title":"Comput.
