Additionally, alternative approaches for teaching this issue of chemistry were developed. However, among students and teachers this topic is still regarded as being difficult and unmotivating. Our approach is to combine (qualitative) investigations with the development and evaluation of specific teaching and learning material. To help students working on stoichiometric problems, we developed a set of stepped supporting tools (SST), based on the results of an interview study investigating the phases of the solution processes of German secondary school students (grade 9) on these problems. Resulting from students’ difficulties detected in the interviews, which were in good agreement to those described in the literature, four different types of SST were developed, (1) giving general instructions on how to tackle (these) problems, (2) showing the steps of the solution process, (3) advising students how to carry these steps out and finally (4) providing them with a glossary of important terms. The method seems also to be applicable to other topics in chemistry, raising the prospect of a catalogue of SST for other problems, too. [Chem. Educ. Res.
